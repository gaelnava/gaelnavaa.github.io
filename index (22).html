        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently an undergraduate student at the University Of Califnornia Riverside. I am currently studying and majoring in Political Science. With this degree I am in hopes of getting into Law School after undergrad. Some of the volunteer work I have done so far include things such as political canvassing and beach trash pick ups. When it comes organizing events or parties, the experience I have from that comes from helping out family members set up for weddings, birthdays, or even holiday events. I collaborate well with other people and am always open to listening to new and bright ideas. I love taking chances because most of the time they bring upon success. I believe that in order to accomplish things, one must do it with positivity and an open mindset!<br><br>

        When it comes to communication I am fortunate enough to be able to speak 2 languages which allows me to further connect with more people and more clients. Communication is also a big key aspect in introducing new ideas so personally for me, I always welcome everyone to chip in any thoughts or ideas that could bring upon progress. This leads on to the next topic I have to offer which is being open to collaboration. Personally I feel one cant do everything alone, so it is important for me that I work with a group of people wo I know will bring new ideas to the table and not only that, but assure that any task we have on hand is done early and effectively. Lastly, when it comes to communication, I feel always showing up with a good attitude is important as we only progress when one is respectful and considerate.<br><br>

        Personally, over the past few years of working with different people, I understand everyone works differently and sometimes it can be diffuclt for some to adjust, but I feel as long as we aknowledge that and overcome it, we can all come to a common gorund on how to get things done. I have always been the type to know that in order to run a successful business, employees and staff must be willing to put in the effort to want to make it successful and in doing so I believe that we must all be open to one another in findings ways on making it successful. I believe that my volunteer and work experience have overall really shaped the way I see these things because in the past, doing everyhting Ive previously mentioned has always brought upon success to whatever it is that I may have been doing such as party planning and canvassing with other people.
